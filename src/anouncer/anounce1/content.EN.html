<p>During the update of version 112-rc.2, serious problems occurred in the development of this software. The reasons are
    as follows:</p>
<p>The developer used a local version detection script to automatically make updates, but in this run involving
    112-rc.2, the script misjudged the BC version and released an unreleased BC version.</p>
<p>Technically, this is a very serious problem. To solve the related problems, this software is going to load the BC web
    page instead and introduce a new cache solution.</p>
